# GLSL - TOTAL BASICS

You may recognize few of examples I've uploaded here. This folder is my first step in learning GLSL, some of the files you can read here are my own ideas and some are based on other peoples articles, books, video tutorials.

I definitely should give credit to Inigo Quilez (creator of shadertoy, author of many articles), Martijn Steinrucken (creator of The Art Of Code channel), Patricio Gonzalez Vivo and Jen Lowe (authors of The Book of Shaders)
