#Sorting

Please note:
  In file BubbleSort.c i have not made typical j<n loop containing sorting loop, I have used a sorting loop and a test if the array is sorted.
 Why? The first one is like (sort iteration)^2 and the second is like (sort iteration)*(test) which in my case takes less lines of code and may often quicker finish sorting.
