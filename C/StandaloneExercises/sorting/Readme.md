#Sorting

Please note:
    In file BubbleSort.c I have not made typical 'for untill j<n' loop containing sorting loop, I have used a sorting loop and a test if the array is sorted.
   Why? The first one is like (sort iteration)^2 and the second is like (sort iteration)*(test) which in my case takes less lines of code to execute and may often quicker finish sorting.
