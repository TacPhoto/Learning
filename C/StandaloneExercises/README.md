# Standalone Exercises
You will find here both examples of functions and programs for demo purposes that actualy are designed to be used by users.
It does not mean they are something more than just exercises but I think they should be listed separately here:

\[newest to oldest]

- Created Learning/C/sorting section, added ROT13, RLE
- Created Learning/C/sorting section, added 3 different Bubble Sorts and Quick Sort
- FindTextInFIle.c - counts all occurances of a typed phrase in the file
- Stack.c - demonstrates how the stack works
- CalcConsoleMacro.c - Console calculator with preprocesor's macros
