# Standalone Exercises
You will find here both examples of functions and programs for demo purposes that actualy are designed to be used by users.
It does not mean they are something more than just exercises but I think they should be listed separately here:

\[newest to oldest]
- FindTextInFIle.c - counts all occurances of a typed phrase in the file
- Stack.c - demonstrates how the stack works
- CalcConsoleMacro.c - Console calculator with preprocesor's macros
- CalcConsole.c - Console calculator. I plan making another one as a window app
