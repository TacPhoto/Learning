# Standalone Exercises
You will find here both examples of functions and programs for demo purposes that actualy are designed to be used by users.
It does not mean they are something more than just exercises but I think they should be listed separately here:

\[newest to oldest]
- CalcConsole.c - Console calculator. I plan making another one as a window app
- CalcConsoleMacro.c - Console calculator with preprocesor's macros
- Stack.c - demonstrates how the stack works
