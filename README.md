# Learning
See my progress learning to code :)
The files in this repository will be probably useless for you. It is just another thing to motivate me and may show you my progress. 
Who knows how far I will go? I may give up after a week or to but it is always good to try :)

Probably most of the in-code comments will be in Polish by the beggining. I will try to keep in mind to write them in English while making future projects. You can find short English descriptions in git file comments.
## Folders
### Language Named Folders - ex. "C"
These folders are design to divide my learning process between different programming languages.
### *Language*/StandaloneExercises
Contains only one file exercises. This folder will prevent creating too messy repository by me ;)
### Other names
Probably as name says.
