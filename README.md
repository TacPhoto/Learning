# Learning 
See my progress learning to code :)
The files in this repository will be probably useless for you. It is just another thing to motivate me and may show you my progress. 
Who knows how far I will go? I may give up after a week or two but it is always good to try :)
# My Learning Order
I was going to learn C, then some algorithms and C++ but my career plans changed the original roadmap ;)
Currently learning basics of shaders, sometimes Python and C++.
Every day doing stuff related with 3d graphics and game industry.
# Story behind this very github in nutshell.
Go to the university, realize they are not teaching you but just trying to show off and waste your time. Give it up, begin learning from the books and internet. Get a job in an AAA company month later and realize how useless the university was.
Keep learning at your job and at home and try to get a degree from a paid academy - just in case.
