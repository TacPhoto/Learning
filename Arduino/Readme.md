#Learning Arduino!
I have bought Arduino Uno, Nano and Digispark to try something new and learn how to use these controlers. I am honestly not sure how far it will go but it is a pretty fun and I wanted to know at least basics of such things and chosen Arduino to begin with.

You probably won't find my projects very interesting... maybe one day but currently they are very basic and I still want to publish some of my codes to have my progress documented and have a bit more motivation :)
Of course feel free to use the code, just do whatever you want to do with it if you think it could be useful for you.

The projects will be sorted by hardware/project file into folders and the source files will be numbered chronologically.

I hope I will try C for AVR one day too ;)
