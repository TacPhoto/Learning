# Learning Machine Learning Python
### (sounds funny ;) )
I think I should know some ML basics at least ;)

##Free Tutorials/Courses I Use
I think I should mention main tutors I learn from:
-Sentdex
-Tech With Tim

##Data Sources
Getting errors while trying to run my code? I sometimes use data files from Tech With Tim page,
I've decided not to include the in my repository (one day I may do that) but you can easily find them
on [TWT: ML Python Tutorials](https://techwithtim.net/tutorials/machine-learning-python/)

I also use sources like Quandl etc, these should work fine for you ;)
